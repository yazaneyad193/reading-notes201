# Here We Will learn HTML Tags

*What is Links  ?*
>Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

*You will commonly come across the following types of links:*

- Links f ●● rom one website to another
- Links from one page to another on the same website
- Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page
- Links that open in a new browser window
- Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone



*Summery*

- Links are created using the a element. Users can click on anything
between the opening a tag and the closing  /a  tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Here We Will learn Layout

- Building Blocks

*CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.*

# Example

*p.example {
position: relative;
top: 10px;
left: 100px;}*



- Overlapping Elements

1. z-Index

- Floating Elements
1. float

- Clearing Floats
1. clear

### JS book:

1. What is JavaScript

*JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.*


> A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.

> Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.

> Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.

> Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.

> JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).

> Expressions evaluate into a single value.

> Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.


3. WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

- Declare a function

function sayhello()
{

}
sayhello();
