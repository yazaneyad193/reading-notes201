## Here We Will learn Color

*The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:*

1. RGB

2. HEX

3. Color Name

*Summery*

- Color not only brings your s XX ite to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.

- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.


- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).


- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
