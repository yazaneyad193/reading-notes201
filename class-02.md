### JS book:

1. What is JavaScript

*JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.*

2. When Javascript is run

*When the browser comes across a script element, it stops to
load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.*

> javascript have Variables Like integer bool string 

3. RULES FOR NAMING
VARIABLES

- The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.

- The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.

- You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.

- All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.

- Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age.

- If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).
